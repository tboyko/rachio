# rachio

Reseeded the lawn and need to water it every hour for the next 10 days. Rachio doesn't currently support setting both a daily start and end time.

This script allows me to turn on and off the Rachio system. Using in conjunction with cron to get the job done.

# usage

    ./rachio [api_key] [on|off]
